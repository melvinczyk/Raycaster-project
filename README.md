# Raycaster

This is a raycaster project that I am implementing in C++. I took the code from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ) which implemented a basic raycaster in python. I tried to convert it from python to C using the CSFML library but the CSFML library was too outdated and wasn't compatible with my machine.

I then decided to make it in C++ mainly because the SFML library sort of works on my machine and it was easier to implement with classes and vectors. Currently this is a work in progress after getting SFML to work.

## Future plans

The main reason why I wanted to create this raycaster was to implement custom maps. I plan on adding a feature to read a file and convert it into a custom map later on after I finish the basics. I am more knowledgeable in C than in C++ but I'm lucky that SFML has a ton of documentation which really made things a lot smoother.
